## Game planning

* There are five Kung Fu students lined up in a row ready to perform Kung Fu forms for their Black Belt test. 
	* give each student their own variables

* Each student has a two-third chance of performing each Kung Fu form perfectly, and a one-third chance of making a mistake.
	* set up an array of "pass, pass, fail" with random 0-2 selections

* Students who perform a form perfectly move on to the next form, while students who do the form incorrectly stop moving on and go back to their previous correct form.
	* use if and elseif to continue or break the pass fail loop
	
* There are a total of nine forms to be attempted: Butterfly, Flower, Dragon, Crane, Snake, Iron Palm, Tiger, Leopard and Dragon's Tail.
	* make an array of the forms and index them

* Any student who performs all forms perfectly becomes a Black Belt. If any students get their Black Belt, everyone wins. If no students get their Black Belt, everyone goes home.
	* use boolean to check if students got to the final form and use if elseif to make final win / lose decision

## Notes for instructor

It sometimes takes about 10 refreshes to get the result when nobody wins.
