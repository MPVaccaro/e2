## Game planning
* There are four players lined up in a row ready to perform Kung Fu forms.
* Each player has a two-third chance to perform a Kung Fu form properly, and a one-third chance of doing it incorrectly.
* Players who do the form correctly move on to the next form. Players who do the form incorrectly stop where they are.
* There are a total of nine tries per player to be attempted.
* The player who performs the most forms wins. If two or more players reach the same form it is a tie and both win.
