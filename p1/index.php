	<p>I'm Mary Vaccaro. I just was accepted as a candidate for a <strong>Masters in Digital Media Design at the Extension School</strong>, so I am now officially on my way.</p>

	<p>In addition to taking these classes, I work full time for a Cannabis Business-to-Business trade show, CWCBExpo,* where I do graphics and photography. In the evenings, I run a small Kung Fu and Tai Chi school in Manhattan.</p>

	<p>I am very excited to take this particular class. In the spring, I took the CMS class and learned the beginnings of building websites with Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal. Although I found Drupal very tough and difficult to understand in the 4 weeks allocated to it, I loved it!</p>

	<p>I loved it so much that I am currently building on my class-made Drupal site with the goal of transferring my decade old Kung Fu sites to the Drupal format.</p>

	<p>I am doing the Drupal install and updates manually. I did not learn Drush and Composer. Adding to that, I have <strong><em>php error messages</em></strong> in the installation.

	<p>There is so much I don't know that this class seems like it will be just what I need.</p>

	<p>I live in NYC but will be coming up to Boston for our CWCBExpo in late October, and I hope to pick up my new Harvard ID and possibly meet some local fellow students then.</p>

	<p><i><small>* If anyone wants free passes to the Expo, let me know.</small></i></p>
