## Game planning

* You, the game player, are a potential student interested in finding out more about Tai Chi. 

* Each time you play the game, you must tell us the main reason you are interested in Tai Chi.
	* Get the player's name, set up a drop down option menu with reasons for trying Tai Chi, and add a comments box. 

* After entering your reason, tell us what other of our options you might enjoy as a future "goal" in the martial arts.  After you answer this question, you click the class button and see what section of the Tai Chi form you've learned.
	* Set up an array listing various Tai Chi sections. Include 7 sections plus 3 listings of "The Whole Form," for a total of 10 array items.
	* Set "random" from 0-9 to select the section learned with a 30% chance of completing the whole form with each try.
	
* If you learn a section of the form, you are ready for your next Tai Chi class.
	* Your game results appear with a photo of a Tai Chi class.

* If you complete the entire Tai Chi form, your next class will be something new.
	* Your game results appear with a photo of a butterfly.

* Under either circumstance, details about the "goal" you selected appear beneath your result.	

* Summary: Game players provide us their name, their reasons for trying Tai Chi and the "goal" or other aspect of the martial arts that sounds the most interesting to them. This is a helpful introduction to the wider range of the martial arts for the potential student, and it provides feedback to us about what students find most interesting.

## Outside resources
I referred w3schools.com for basic HTML and CSS review items.

## Notes for instructor

I formulated this project thinking that it might be a useful data-gathering feature in a future website for my capstone project.  Although I am a long way from this, I am trying to accomplish something towards this goal in each class that I take.  I used the menu bar and css code that I put together in the "Fundamentals of Website Development."  All the images and text in this project are mine.
