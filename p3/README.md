## Game planning

* You are a student entering a Tai Chi class. 

* Each time you come to a Tai Chi class, you must tell us the main reason you are interested in Tai Chi.
	* set up a drop down option menu with reasons for trying Tai Chi.

* After entering your reason, you can begin learning the Tai Chi form.
	* Set up an array listing various Tai Chi sections. Include 7 sections plus 3 listings of "The Whole Form", for a total of 10 array items.
	* Set random from 0-9 to select the section learned with a 30% chance of completing the whole form with each try.
	
* If you learn a section of the form, you are ready for your next Tai Chi class.
	* the text is brown and a photo of a Tai Chi class appears.

* If you learn the entire Tai Chi form, we celebrate by teaching you the Sabre.
	* use boolean to check if you learned the whole form.  If so, the text is green and a photo of a class learning the Sabre appears.


## Outside resources
I referred to php.net and w3schools.com often.
In particular, I took the ```required``` code from w3 schools.

## Notes for instructor

I did this about 10 different ways, each complicated by various errors, before I finally got it to work. For the final version, I used your coin-flip code as a template. To that, I item-by-item added in my own code.  When an error appeared, I went back and re-did it until it was error free. At the end I cleaned it up and deleted the excess code.
